# /etc/pam.d/common-auth - authentication settings common to all services
#
# This file is included from other service-specific PAM config files,
# and should contain a list of the authentication modules that define
# the central authentication scheme for use on the system
# (e.g., /etc/shadow, LDAP, Kerberos, etc.).  The default is to use the
# traditional Unix authentication mechanisms.
#

# Accept any Unix authentication if not empty; empty ones only for secure ttys
auth	sufficient	pam_unix.so nullok_secure

# Accept LDAP authentication for users with uid >= 1000
auth	requisite	pam_succeed_if.so uid >= 1000 quiet
auth	sufficient	pam_ldap.so use_first_pass

# Deny access otherwise
auth	required	pam_deny.so
