# This file shows the available options to configure WebGate.
# Lines beginning with '#' are comments and are ignored. If you
# want to change the value of an option, please uncomment the  
# line. Default values (shown here) are used, unless           
# otherwise indicated.                                         


# Specify the port on which WebGate listens for HTTP requests.
# Web-based FTP requests are also handled on this port. In addition
# to the port number, you may optionally specify a hostname or IP  
# address to which WebGate binds the socket. If you do not specify 
# any port(s), WebGate listens on port 8080 for HTTP requests by   
# default. If you specify at least one of FTPPort or ICAPPort,     
# WebGate does not open a port for HTTP requests as long as        
# HTTPPort is commented out (default).                             
# Usage: HTTPPort [hostname_or_ip:]port                            
# Note: If you have installed WebGate as a parent proxy on the     
#       same machine as your existing proxy, it is recommended to  
#       use "HTTPPort 127.0.0.1:8080" for example. If a hostname   
#       or IP is not given, then the port will be bound to all     
#       interfaces.

# WebGate can be used as a "real" FTP proxy (talking FTP to the
# clients). In order to enable this feature, you need to specify
# a port on which WebGate listens for FTP connections. In addition
# to the port number, you may optionally specify a hostname or IP 
# address to which WebGate binds the socket. If you specify an    
# FTPPort, WebGate does not open a port for HTTP requests unless  
# HTTPPort is specified explicitly (uncommented).                 
# Usage: FTPPort [hostname_or_ip:]port                            
#FTPPort 2121                                                     

# WebGate can be used as an ICAP server. To enable ICAP support,
# you need to specify a port, optionally along with a hostname or
# IP address, to which WebGate binds the socket. If you specify an
# ICAPPort, WebGate does not open a port for HTTP requests unless 
# HTTPPort is specified explicitly (uncommented).                 
# Usage: ICAPPort [hostname_or_ip:]port                           
# WebGate supports ICAP version "1.0"

# WebGate will switch the user and group as soon as possible after
# the startup. You may specify a user and/or group to which WebGate
# will switch to. Note that you must first run WebGate as root.    
# If you don't want WebGate to start up as root, you must          
# specify the current user/group here, otherwise the start will fail.

# WebGate no longer starts the SAVAPI daemon. Instead it connects 
# to a running instance using an unix socket.                     
# IMPORTANT: if you change the socket location, you must also     
# change the scanner config file (default /etc/avwebgate-scanner.conf)

# WebGate is able to tunnel requests performed over SSL (HTTPS).
# Because the data can not be decrypted, the data will NOT be   
# scanned. However, the handshake is checked to determine if it 
# is a valid  SSL handshake. Although this adds an extra security
# check, this does not solve the underlaying problem: SSL data will
# NOT be checked, so WebGate does not interfere with the transaction,
# but merely forwards the data.                                      
# Attention: HTTPS data will _NOT_ be scanned.                       
#AllowHTTPSTunnel 0                                                  

# For security reasons, WebGate restricts HTTPS connections to 
# IANA-assigned ports 443 (HTTPS) and 563 (SNEWS). If you want to
# allow HTTPS connections to non-standard ports, you can do so by
# adding the desired ports to this list. Each port will be separated 
# by a comma or a whitespace.                                        
#AllowedHTTPConnectPorts 443, 563

# In order to prevent client timeouts with large downloads, WebGate
# must send the client keepalive messages. There are three different
# methods for timeout prevention. If the client was identified as   
# a browser, the progress status is sent as refreshing HTML pages.  
# The RefreshInterval specifies the number of seconds between       
# status updates. This method of timeout prevention can be disabled 
# by setting RefreshInterval to 0. If RefreshInterval is not        
# specified, this method of timeout prevention is disabled.         
#RefreshInterval 0                                                  

# If the refresh method is not used (because it is disabled or
# the client is a non-browser), redirect messages can be sent to the
# client. The RedirectInterval specifies the delay time in seconds  
# for sending redirect messages. This method of timeout prevention  
# can be disabled by setting RedirectInterval to 0. If              
# RedirectInterval is not specified, this method of timeout         
# prevention is disabled.                                           
# Note: This method does not work with every client. Use the        
#       KeepaliveInterval option instead if problems occur.         
#RedirectInterval 0                                                 

# If the refresh and redirect methods are not used (because they
# are disabled or they are not appropriate) extended header data can
# be sent to the client to prevent timeouts. The KeepaliveInterval  
# specifies the delay time in seconds for sending extended header   
# data. This method of timeout prevention can be disabled by        
# setting KeepaliveInterval to 0.

# If you want to use an optional parent HTTP proxy, WebGate needs
# information to connect to the proxy where the requests are forwarded.
# You can also specify a username and password if they are needed for  
# the proxy.

# If the number of bits is not specified, the netmask will be    
# determined from the given address (for example, 192.168.0.0 is

# the categories.                                                      
# ADSPY: Software that displays advertising pop-ups or software, that very
#        often, without the user's consent, sends user specific data to   
#        third parties and might therefore be unwanted.                   
# APPL: The term APPL/ denotes an application of dubious origin or which  
#       might be hazardous to use.
# BDC: Is the Control software for backdoors. Control software for
#      backdoors are generally harmless.
# DIAL: A Dial-Up program for connections that charge a fee. Its use might
#       lead to huge costs for the user.
# GAME: It concerns a game that causes no damage on your computer.
# HEUR-DBLEXT: The file has an executable file extension, but hides it behind a
#              harmless one.
# JOKE: A harmless joke program is present as file.
# PCK: File has been compressed with an unusual runtime compression tool.
#      Please make sure that this file comes from a trustworthy source.
# PHISH: Faked emails that are supposed to prompt the victim to reveal
#        confidential information such as user accounts, passwords or
#        online-banking data on certain websites.
# SPR: Software that may be able to compromise the security of your system,
#      initiate unwanted program activities, damage your privacy or spy
#      out your user behavior and might therefore be unwanted.
# Detection can be enabled/disabled with yes/no parameters respectively.

#DetectAPPL yes
#DetectBDC yes

# If you want to enable detection for all the categories above,
# you can uncomment the following parameter. Note that
# this will enable detection for all the unwanted programs,
# overwriting their individual values.
#DetectAllTypes

# AntiVir is capable of using heuristics to determine if a file
# may be malicious. This allows new or unknown malicious code to
# be detected before you have had a chance to perform an update.
# There are two types of heuristics that AntiVir uses. The
# first, HeuristicsMacro, only deals with macros in office
# documents. This can be enabled/disabled with yes/no respectively.
# The second, HeuristicsLevel, deals with all types of files and
# can be set to a certain level of intensity (0-3). 0 means
# disabled and 3 means full intensity.
# Note: Be aware that setting the HeuristicsLevel too high could
#       result in false alerts.
#HeuristicsMacro yes
#HeuristicsLevel 2
